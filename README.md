# Bank-Telemarketing-Campaign-Case-Study.
Providing Solutions for the future marketing campaigns using EDA Concepts

**Problem statement**

The bank provides financial services/products such as savings accounts, current accounts, debit cards, etc. to its customers. In order to increase its overall revenue, the bank conducts various marketing campaigns for its financial products such as credit cards, term deposits, loans, etc. These campaigns are intended for the bank’s existing customers. However, the marketing campaigns need to be cost-efficient so that the bank not only increases their overall revenues but also the total profit. You need to apply your knowledge of EDA on the given dataset to analyse the patterns and provide inferences/solutions for the future marketing campaigns.

A bank conducted a telemarketing campaign for one of its financial products called ‘Term Deposits’ to help foster long-term relationships with existing customers. The dataset contains information about all the customers who were contacted during a particular year to open term deposit accounts with the bank.



**Term deposit**

Term deposits, also called fixed deposits, are the cash investments made for a specific time period ranging from 1 month to 5 years for predetermined fixed interest rates. The fixed interest rates offered for term deposits are higher than the regular interest rates for savings accounts. The customers receive the total amount (investment plus the interest) at the end of the maturity period. Also, the money can only be withdrawn at the end of the maturity period. Withdrawing money before that will result in penalty charges, and the customer will not receive any interest returns.
